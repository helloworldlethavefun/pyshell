# Pyshell

Hello welcome to the pyshell git! Pyshell is basicly a bash skin. It is a 
project I am working on and has lots to be done!


## Features
Pyshell has some features yet to be implemented but hopefully by the end will include:
- Config files, for customizing
- custom aliases
- color coding
- custom variables
- and more!


## As I have noted
### This is still a work in progress and is not even near finished
### if you have any suggestions feel free to let me know


Thanks guys
